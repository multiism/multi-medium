# <span style="font-family: 'Seoge Print', 'Seoge Script', 'Seoge', cursive">MultiMedium</span>

A new version of the handwriting medium, now for the web.

Write more personally, but with the benefits of the web such as copy and paste.

See a [demo](http://multiism.github.io/multi-medium/).

## TODO

* Shift handwritten word to the left by *`min_x`*
* Use less arbitrary coordinate system
* Undo/redo
* Draw dots (currently you have to drag a small line)
* Write longer words
	* A metaphorical hyphen gesture
	* Or automatically give your room when you near the edge
	* Shift the word off left with an animation (and continue showing part of it)
* Handwriting conversion mode (writing out existing text)
	* Placeholder text / show prompted word for writing
	* Next word button
	* Easily export the data for persistence (paste into html)
	* Save to `localStorage`
* Freewriting mode / WYSIWYG editor
* Establish API boundaries
* jQuery-plugin-like API
	* And actual jQuery plugin, why not (but no dependency)
* Publish to npm
* Use scalable vector graphics
* Optimize?
* Fix triple-clicking a paragraph to select it
* Hide text underneath canvases when selecting? Or hide canvases?
* Support other languages better
